# ProgrammingBuildingBlocks

ProgrammingBuildingBlocks is a library comprising of programs to help you start programming in C++. It contains some very basic programs of Data Structure, Searching Algorithms, Sorting Algorithms etc. written in C++.

These programs were written by me when I was in 11th grade. I hope if you are starting to write code, you'll find it useful.

## Installation

Use any C++ compiler to run the file.
